# Aim
 The wiper serves to clean the windshield of the car at the front. WIper works by removing oil, dust, rainwater, and dirt that get stuck to the windshield.
 A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions.The control signal is applied 
 to a wiper driver circuit to adjust the operational speed or timing in accordance with the control signal.
 
# Objectives
the main objectives includes:
* The main objective is to design and manufacture a new mechanism to cover the complete area of the wind screen.
* The main purpose of the wiper system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times.
*  At present, engineers are investigating fully automated systems that vary the speed of the wiper blades according to the rate of the rainfall
   and the speed of the vehicle.
* The systemcontains a microcontroller that takes in the input signals from the sensors and controls the operation of the windshield wipers
  based on those input signals. 
  
# Introduction
 Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed and made to clear the water from a windscreen.
 The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding theblade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots.
 The wiper itself has about six parts called pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper.Existing system manually used control stalk to activate
 wiper and the process of pulling up wiper and the driver needs to switch on and off the control stalk.

# 4W's and 1H
# What
* A windshield wiper system comprises a wiper drive and two wiper arms.
# When
* the wiper starts to turn on, the wiper motor will rotate the crank arm and this will make the connecting rods pull and push each other.
# Where
* wiper blade is a device used to remove rain,dust particles,snow ice...etc.
# Who 
* wiper system is used to clean windscreen sufficiently to provide visibility to drive all the times.
# How
* Windshield wipers are operated by an electric motor.The electric motor is attached to a worm gear, which transmits the necessary force to a long rod that sets 
  the wiper arms in motion.
